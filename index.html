                            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;" ><p>Virtual therapy, also known as online therapy or teletherapy, is a form of mental health treatment that occurs over the internet, through a computer, tablet, or smartphone. It allows individuals to access therapy sessions from the comfort of their homes or any other location without traveling to a therapist’s office. Depending on the platform and the therapist’s preference, virtual therapy can take various forms, including video chat sessions, messaging, or phone calls. It offers the same level of care and confidentiality as in-person therapy and can be just as effective for treating mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.</p></div>
